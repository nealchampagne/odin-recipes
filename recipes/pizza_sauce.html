  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is the pizza sauce from my uncle's old pizza shop. He 
      purchased it in large cans from a restaurant supplier but it
      wasn't available in retail stores so I took it upon myself to 
      reverse-engineer it from memory over a period of years. This
      recipe tastes almost exactly like I remember from my childhood.
    </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>28 oz can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tbsp oregano</li>
    <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Crush, chop, or blend tomatoes depending on your preference.</li>
    <li>Add tomatoes, olive oil, oregano, salt, garlic, and black pepper 
      to a medium-sized pan and stir.</li>
    <li>Simmer over medium low heat for 20-30 minutes.
      Sauce should coat the back of a spoon.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice, and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
